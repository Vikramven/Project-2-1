Rules:

Dice Chess is a variant of the classic Chess in which a dice is used to add randomness to the game. However, the goal remains the same: capture the opponent's King.

1. At every turn, the player rolls three dice. The outcome determines which pieces can be used for that move.
2. In this version, there is no check or checkmate. It is allowed to move the King to a square attacked by an opponent's piece.
3. In the case that a pawn would advance to the last row, the player has the right to move it even if none of the dice showed it. However, the player is only allowed to promote the pawn to one of the pieces chosen by the dice.
